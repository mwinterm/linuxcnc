QtPlasmaC THCAD Setup Page

Model:
Select the model of the THCAD from one of 5, 10, or 300.

F Jumper:
Select the F jumper setting from one of 1, 32, 64, or 128.

0V Frequency & Full Scale Frequency:
Enter the zero volt frequency and the full scale frequency exactly as 
displayed on the calibration sticker on the THCAD card.

Divider Ratio:
For the arc voltage encoder, the divider ratio may be entered as a divider
ratio or as a series resistance.
If using a plasma machine with a CNC port and it has an onboard divider with 
a ratio of 20:1 then enter 20.
If using the full arc voltage with a series resistance then enter the total 
value of resistance in ohms. 2MegOhm would be entered as 2000000.

Encoder:
If the mesa card has standard firmware then only ENCA is able to be used so
this restricts the use to arc voltage only.

To use an additional encoder for ohmic sensing requires a firmware update to
the mesa card. Use a mesa bit file with pl in the name.

Currently supported firmwares are:
  5i25_7i76x2pld.bit
  7i76e_7i76x1_Dpl.bit
  7i92_7i76x1dpl.bit
  7i96dpl.bit

This then enables three single encoders encoder.00, encoder.01, and encoder.02
which are available for both arc voltage and ohmic sensing.

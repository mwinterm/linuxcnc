.SH NAME
iocontrol \- accepts NML I/O commands, interacts with HAL in userspace
 

.SH SYNOPSIS


.B [EMCIO] 
.br
.B EMCIO = io
.br
or
.br
.B EMCIO = iov2

.SH DESCRIPTION

iocontrol handles I/O tasks like coolant, toolchange, e-stop and lube. The
signals are turned on and off with G code or in the case of e-stop
in hal.
.P
iocontrol is a userspace process - if you have strict timing
requirements or simply need more i/o, consider using the realtime
synchronized i/o provided by \fBmotion\fR(9) instead.
.P
The inifile is searched for in the directory from which halcmd was run, unless an absolute path is specified.

.SH PINS

These pins are created by the userspace IO controller, usually found in $LINUXCNC_HOME/bin/io and loaded by ini file setting: [EMCIO]EMCIO=io.
.P
See the individual manpages for io and iov2 for pin descriptions.
